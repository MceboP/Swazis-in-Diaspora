                              <p>The first time I had to be brave was when I was 5 years old but that isn’t what today’s reflection is about, however that was when I realized that bravery is too often ill fitting.  </p>

                              <p>The second time I had to be brave I was 18 years old and I had to take public transport to go to Mbabane to check on the status of my study permit. My father, who up to that point in my life had accompanied me everywhere, was unavailable on that day. I wasn’t scared until he looked at me, keys jangling in his hands trying very hard to look preoccupied with getting into the car and delivering words that have defined my life in as casual a way as he could muster, and said “sisi you should wear a skirt but it mustn’t be too short in case you’re judged based on how you are dressed”. I paused and we stared at each other for a beat before I mumbled “okay Daddy” and went to change into a skirt that was not too short. I didn’t push back, I didn’t question – and that is the Swati way isn’t it. We are ruled by fear, by apprehension, by despotism that refers to suppression as peace.</p>

                              <blockquote>For the 15 years since then I have been living with the understanding that unless I conform to things that may or may not make sense to me, I could be excluded from opportunities no matter how deserving I am. That wears on the spirit.</blockquote>

                              <p>That sometimes something as innocuous as the clothes on your body will exclude you from access, that you must anticipate the actions of your aggressor to ensure you stay safe, that there is no space for you here unless you are ready to lower your gaze and soften your voice and wear the skirt that is not too short. The night is truly dark and full of terrors.</p>

                              <p>In this country the shadow pandemic of silence has taken too many lives and livelihoods. We have seen too many people die because they dared to question the systemic pitfalls of this country. We have seen people, the likes of Comrade Mphandlana gaslit for years for daring to speak up for an inclusive political dispensation. We have seen firebrands being swallowed by the same system because bravery in a country like ours too often feels like an exercise in futility – so they wear the skirt that is not too short and stop asking questions. </p>

                              <p>However, over time I began to notice the simple things such as access to buildings, parking allocated to people living with disabilities, and many more. I did what a good quality education afforded me the opportunity to do, as a then member of the ableist society - empower myself through reading about disabled people’s experiences and how socioeconomic support improves lives. I learned that Eswatini is not accessible. This was even though the country had a National Disability Plan of Action (NDPA) for 2015-2020 with multiple objectives, one being to remove environmental, structural, physical, social, and cultural barriers which restrict the capacity of Persons with Disabilities to participate fully in the life of the community. The NDPA reports that Eswatini is now accessible for all people, yet with all my privileges, I struggle to access so many services and amenities, some of these being government services.</p>

                              <p>We have had to be brave countless times in our existence as emaSwati. That is why the resolve of the three MPs; Mduduzi Gawuzela Simelane, Mduduzi Bacede Mabuza and Mthandeni Dube is astounding. Never in my life did I think I would see the Eswatini political space play out like this. We have had countless outspoken, and dare I say inspiring, parliamentarians but for the first time we are seeing the will of the people in action. We are seeing what the Tinkhundla system claims to be about at play and it is bewildering how the enforcers of that same system are intent on suppressing how it manifests. </p>

                              <p>I’ve been doing a lot of reading lately on systems thinking and there is something about endogenous thought in there – firstly a system is made up of interacting elements for a clear purpose. Secondly endogenous thought says when the system is no longer functioning to deliver the intended output that is not the problem of the environment, instead it means the system itself is the cause of the dysfunction. Therefore if anyone is advising the puppet master they may want to highlight the fact that the environment will get rid of a system that does not pay attention to trends and events as insight into what the people within the system want.</p>

                              <p>The thing about sustained violence is that it will radicalize even the meekest among us because oppression is uncomfortable, tyranny is suffocating and what happens when you make sure people have nothing is that the day they choose to fight they have nothing to lose. We are brave not because we hate our country but because it is all we have left and we can no longer afford to abandon ourselves. The cost of abandoning our bravery is simply too high.</p>
