                              <p>Human beings are beyond complex and we know it but take it for granted when it becomes too hard to grant the grace we speak of. There is a concept in Psychology called Stockholm syndrome. This is a psychological condition in which hostages form a bond with their captors and thereby refuse to testify against them or cooperate with the police. This concept has also been used to explain the reasons as to why people protect and defend their abusers. There is however an element of this condition that nobody else seems to want to explore, the element where as a victim you are in love with your abuser.  </p>

                              <p>Months ago, Swazis experienced a digital cleansing within which survivors of sexual assault decided to share their experiences online. Started by a brave survivor who had decided to throw up the poison she has had to swallow down in order to protect someone who chose to violate her; the cleansing saw them fall like dominos. From men who have heard NOs and decided to proceed to men who have held down screaming women, they were all visibly quiet and uncomfortable. Men who bombard us with questionable selfies and hot takes on dishing of plates at braais all of a sudden had not a sigh to offer up. It was something special.</p>

                              <p>The calls to cancel and socially isolate the men accused was loud and clear that day. It also proved to be a bone of contention as some people were clinging to the Sony lenses and bike pedals of their bromances. It seemed the obligatory annual calls to “protect our women okes” was just as smoke and mirrors as it always sounded. It seems we have come full circle as calls to dissociate from the benefactors of the current regime are getting louder. Those in defense of the status quo seen as singing for their literal supper, (it helped not that some of these PR videos were made on dinner tables) we have once again decided to ignore that they could be experiencing some deep rooted internal conflicts.</p>

                              <p>Imagine your whole life has been spent drinking and breathing in the borrowed golden trimmed robes of excess and then out of nowhere a gospel singer out of the dustiest parts of the Lubombo region decides to be an inconvenience. You haven’t even finished uploading your IG reels in your hand me down Louboutins and now the whole country is on fire and some hooligans are screaming democracy. Can you imagine the mental confusion and identity crisis as you recall that these people are coming from homes just like yours? That the borrowed gowns remain at the gilded gates as you return to your actual life of hopelessness. I too would hang on to my Peruvian weave and hide behind layers of MAC foundation rather than admit that I too am a victim.</p>

                              <p>I am writing this not to berate or mock those that feel that the status quo suits them but to display my empathy as I too know what it is to be in love with your abuser. I too know what it is like to fool yourself into thinking that maybe you are different from the other victims because there is a mutual love and respect between you and the violator. That picking up left-over caviar from heated floors just like smiles from your rapist mean that the abuse didn’t happen. That proximity to first tables at dinners is equivalent to respect and humanity. </p>

                              <p>I want us to be more conscious next time that we demand people to take a stand, not because we need to coddle people into accountability but to be aware of what we are really asking. When we ask people to mute R Kelly are we aware we are asking people who still pray for their rapists? That we are asking people who cannot even stomach the idea of bringing justice to people who beat them to an inch of their lives? You are asking people like me, who worry about the wellbeing of their rapist to cancel people who raped others. It is not always out of defiance that people do not rise as quick as we wish towards justice. Sometimes it is purely from the thorny but warm blanket of cognitive dissonance, the knowing of the truth but failure to admit to oneself or even act in accordance with it. Untangling yourself from perceived privilege I assume must be internally confusing and excruciating. Largely because you would have to begin with admitting that you allowed your identity to be used as a sanitizer for the virus filled dirty hands of what is now a murderous regime. You would have to let go of the imagination that one day those royal garbs will be yours and marrying into the family will somehow make you special like a designer handkerchief that wipes snort as much as the one from PEP Boutique. Facing the price you paid for things that melt in the scorching rays of justice, must be enough to drive one into a perpetual state of insanity. So until then if you are committed to unraveling yourself from the mistakes you made, then I will be right next to you hand in hand as I unravel the loyalty that I have to my rapist. Hopefully some day soon, we can both learn to not step in the name of love but step in the name of truth as well.</p>
