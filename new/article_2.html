                              <h2>How It All Started</h2>
                              <p><i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o"></i> 02/07/2021</p>

                              <p>A cursory look at the Twitter timeline shows that eSwatini is trending lately, and why exactly should the world’s eyes be fixed on the small kingdom? why should we care? The tiny landlocked country in Southern Africa, sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique, is home to the last absolute monarch in Africa – His Majesty King Mswati III.</p>

                              <blockquote>The country was previously called The Kingdom of Swaziland until the King decided to rename it to The Kingdom of eSwatini. Reportedly 70% of the people live in abject poverty, below the poverty line on less than USD 1.9 per day or E27 in the local Emalangeni currency. With little to no infrastructure to speak of, life is extremely tough for tertiary educated young people with no job opportunities languishing in poverty.</blockquote>

                              <p>That is the reason Swazis verily leave the country in search of greener pastures in other countries, mainly neighboring South Africa.</p>

                              <p>In May of 2021 the cover-up by police of the murder of Thabani Nkomonye set off a catastrophic chain of events far exceeding those last seen in the uprising on April 12, 2011. The 24 year old law student at the University of eSwatini (UNESWA) went missing on 08 May 2021. Police encouraged the family to open a missing person’s case on 11 May 2021, sending them on a wild goose chase. The family was reliably informed that a vehicle matching the description of Thabani’s was at the police pound all along.</p>

                              <p>The state in which the vehicle was in made it abundantly clear that a violent altercation had ensued. The family demanded to be taken to the scene where the vehicle had been recovered for possible clues that could lead to their son’s whereabouts. Instead a grisly discovery was made of Thabani’s decomposing corpse that had suffered multiple fractures, confirming the earlier suspicion that his death had been a violent one, however the police claimed to not know. The community caught wind of this and formed a movement on digital platforms under the; #JusticeForThabani and #EndPoliceBrutality.</p>

                              <p>Young people took to the streets in a series of peaceful demonstrations, however the heavy-handed response of police was to fire teargas and disperse the protesters. On one incident a motorist caught in the gridlocked traffic congestion was shot in the eye at close range. In another a four month old baby was killed by the teargas fumes. The spark was lit for the people to demand more reforms, including the right to elect their own prime minister as opposed to one nominated by the king.</p>

                              <p>The first act of civil disobedience came when the government banned gatherings, rather than to address the legitimate issues raised by citizens. The order came on the eve of a memorial service organized for Thabani by the community. The people forged ahead despite the banishment order while adhering to COVID19 regulations. The police showed up in tankers and fired teargas and rubber bullets sending mourners helter-skelter. A resolution was then made to deliver petitions to local (tinkhundla) constituencies.</p>

                              <p>Two weeks into the delivery of petitions government again issued another order that the delivery of petitions be suspended with immediate effect due to the third wave of COVID19. In anticipation of the people’s noncompliance the government sent police officers to the home of a pro-democracy member of parliament, to prevent him from leaving his house to go meet with his constituency to accept their petitions.</p>

                              <p>These events cemented the perfect breeding ground for the civil unrest that has since broken loose under the banner of #KungahlwaKwenile wherein the government has resolved to arbitrarily shoot and kill riotous protesters and dissenters rather than address their grievances.</p>
