                              <blockquote>How many times have you used the disabled parking even though you know you are not disabled in any way?  </blockquote>

                              <p>When you walk up and down the beautiful steps at the entrance of your office building, does it occur to you that that simple construction design is restrictive?  </p>

                              <p>When you see an “elevator not working, please use the stairs” sign that’s been up for weeks, do you pause and reflect on how people with limited mobility are excluded from accessing your office?</p>

                              <p>Reflecting on your educational experience, how many visually impaired students were in your class, and provided with the same learning opportunity with the right tools to support their education?</p>

                              <p>The World Bank estimates about two thirds of all persons with severe to moderate disabilities live in poverty. They belong to the poorest of the poor of the world's population and are acutely affected by shortages in water, food, and housing, bad or non-existent public transportation and health care, and the lack of employment or other income opportunities.</p>

                              <blockquote>According to the national population and housing census of 2017, there are 176 184 disabled people in Eswatini, 16.1% of the population. This means for every 10 people in Eswatini, at least one of them is disabled, and yet when you look around you, how many disabled people do you know?</blockquote>

                              <p>I have been living with a disability for over 2 years, and in that time, I came to realize just how privileged I am. I was already employed when my disability presented itself, my income was secure and came with benefits such as medical aid to support me. When my condition worsened and I could no longer use public transportation, I could afford to hire a taxi to take me to and from work. After a year I had managed to review my finances to afford to buy a car. So initially, I couldn’t truly appreciate how disability affected EmaSwati in their day to day lives. </p>

                              <p>However, over time I began to notice the simple things such as access to buildings, parking allocated to people living with disabilities, and many more. I did what a good quality education afforded me the opportunity to do, as a then member of the ableist society - empower myself through reading about disabled people’s experiences and how socioeconomic support improves lives. I learned that Eswatini is not accessible. This was even though the country had a National Disability Plan of Action (NDPA) for 2015-2020 with multiple objectives, one being to remove environmental, structural, physical, social, and cultural barriers which restrict the capacity of Persons with Disabilities to participate fully in the life of the community. The NDPA reports that Eswatini is now accessible for all people, yet with all my privileges, I struggle to access so many services and amenities, some of these being government services.</p>

                              <p>Additionally, in a country with so many people living with disabilities, it was shocking then to hear the PS of Office of the Deputy Prime Minister report that as of  March 2021 the DPM’s office was only issuing social grants to 5 000 disabled people, which is less than 5% of the total disabled population. While I was reeling from the lack of socio-economic support for disabled people, I noticed that there are government buildings with elevators that have holes in the floor, others without elevators and many do not have a person in the building who can interpret sign language. This means people with disabilities traveling alone cannot be assured that they will access government services. There are ramps added next to staircases in some places, but this shows that accessibility is assumed to be a ramp for wheelchair access and nothing else. The NDPA specifically reports that Persons with Disabilities can enjoy inclusive, social, sporting, and cultural facilities and activities. The reality on the ground is very different from what was reported. </p>

                              <p>Persons with disabilities would stand a better chance to improved quality of life if their needs were more than just items being ticked off a list of international conventions on the rights of people with disabilities. The country aims for inclusivity on paper, but without representation across the broader societal spectrum (education, healthcare, etc.), but more especially in Parliament or the Senate, there is therefore nobody with direct interest in the rights of disabled people who can influence and lobby for execution of all the promises made to make Eswatini accessible, by improving access to education and ensuring full economic participation of disabled people.</p>
