                              <h2>REFLECTIONS ON BEING A YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WORKING ESWATINI</h2>
                              <p><h5 class="h5">by Senele Mdluli </h5><i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o"></i> 14/08/2021</p>

                              <p>The last six years of my life have taught me more about the challenges and difficulties that the majority of emaSwati face that my earlier life may have sheltered me from. I grew up in Mbabane. It was a typical middle class existence. This typically means any health care I needed I accessed through private health care and I attended private schools. I did not have everything (privilege is always relative and never absolute) but I had more than enough. I was aware of poverty and inequality but because of positioning it was a bit of an abstract concept. When people spoke about Eswatini as a peaceful and stable country, I could easily lap it up. I have never had to go stand for a government scholarship and explain why I should justify me getting a scholarship and name the mountains and the valleys in my home area.</p>

                              <p>When I was 17 years I completed my Form 5 and left the country to complete my AS Levels, undergraduate and post-graduate qualifications. This totaled a period of 8 years of living, studying and working (briefly) outside the country. In South Africa, the systems around which my education and my subsequent profession were organized were well structured, transparent and for the most part, just. Affirmative Action and dismantling the systemic legacy of apartheid is not easy and there are limitations, but the efforts were intentional and it showed more visibly in some areas than others. I have never felt that any decision that was taken about me in providing me opportunities to study were based on whose daughter I was, where I came from or that I had to do anything other than reach my full potential and be consistent in my work to have a chance at certain opportunities.  </p>

                              <p>I then had to return to the country in 2015. I was reluctant, but I was also in a health-related profession where there was now a SADC agreement that people who study outside their country would have to return to their country of origin on completion of their studies because their skills training are limited in the countries they come from. In my last study permit application, I had had to sign that agreement at the South African High Commissioner’s. Fair enough I guess, we are educated and should want to come back to serve and provide our skills and knowledge in the countries we are from, right? So I came back; young, bright eyed, newly qualified with a heart of serving mental health needs in my country and making the most of opportunities. I was aware that systemically and structurally there was plenty of work to do in the field I was in. My attitude was still positive about it though.</p>

                              <p>So now I am no longer a young girl with a sheltered upbringing, I am now inserted into the heart of people’s experiences and what Eswatini looks like. My first job in Eswatini was for a humanitarian international health organization where I provided mental health care services in rural Shiselweni. That was my induction into realizing the levels of poverty and marginalization that many of emaSwati were living. You can never unsee poverty once you see it in its raw form. You are not stopping by the road on your way to somewhere, You are now immersed in a community and you are the one that gets to live through hearing the narratives and trauma that life has handed the people in it. Poverty is an on-going mental health crisis. I felt overwhelmed, and I sometimes felt helpless because I was aware at how the mental health issues that presented were not only individual intra-personal dynamics but also stemmed from disenfranchisement and poverty. I was working in an environment where mental health resources were limited, so access to medication, specialized referral and inter-disciplinary collaboration were limited. We learn very early in this country to do what we can with what we have.</p>

                              <p>The country at the time was promoting the 1st World Vision 2022 and from afar I had thought this country had a fighting chance at getting there. But after that experience I remember saying to someone <i>“If there is any place going to 1st world in this country it might be the Mbabane-Manzini corridor, the rest of the country as it is, is still far from that.”</i></p>

                              <p>I subsequently then started working in a higher education institution that was three years old at the time. I was excited. It was the first department of psychology in the country. When you consider that the first academic department of psychology in the world was established in the 1870s, Eswatini finally establishing one over one hundred years later was just a delayed necessary component of a society building a knowledge base for understanding itself. You may also want to ask yourself what it is about this country that takes so long to prioritize a knowledge discipline whose application encompasses understanding human behavior, mental health and positive social and community change. If education in this country is underfunded, higher education is the least prioritized. I became aware of this. I worked in a system where resources were limited. Where we consistently had to raise awareness on what was best for students and have those needs not addressed. </p>

                              <p>One of the reasons why a young professional would work in an academic institution is to fast track their processes for doctoral studies. This is highly difficult when you work in limited resources and have a high workload. You additionally do not have any professional seniors in the country, so your professional growth, further training and development is still largely dependent on South African resources and professionals. That I have been part of the education of 4 cohorts of students is still a humbling experience for me. Teaching and working with young people in Eswatini politicized me and my psychology in ways nothing else had. I wanted to give them a fighting chance at a decent education. I wanted them to measure up to their peers regionally and internationally. I saw how hard they had to do to access resources that I in my own education had not had to even think twice about. Many of them excelled through these challenges. I remain resolute as a result of this experience that the country does not do justice to young people in this country.</p>

                              <p>I later combined my academic and clinical work for professional growth and recently decided to focus on my work as a psychotherapist and consultant. This is because the system exhausts you in this country. I am fortunate to work in a profession that allows me some form of independence. It is not without challenges, but being able to survive, thrive and earn an income in this country without being employed by anyone but yourself is a privilege I do not take lightly. I am fortunate to also be able to make professional decisions that prioritize my mental health without dire consequences because my so-called black tax is virtually non-existent. Doing this however, has also meant working in a way that makes me virtually inaccessible to marginalized groups or people who cannot afford the mental services I provide. There are structural barriers within state institutions that means a significant majority of qualified mental health professionals in this country cannot work in the context that allows them to serve communities which otherwise would not have been able to afford their services. “Free services” in a capitalist society only means that the cost of the service has been removed from the end user. Unless government and other relevant organizations become willing to prioritize mental health in this aspect, the impact of mental health work and who benefits from it will remain limited. </p>

                              <p>So when people ask me if I have regrets about coming back to this country after studying, my response is yes, I do, it has been hard in many ways. It can easily be disempowering. However, it has influenced my politics, the direction I want my work to take and has forced me to stretch myself and challenge myself to grow in ways in which in a more resource filled and supported context, I may have remained in comfort zones forever. We are grateful to be here, we also resent being here too and we must hold both these contradictions to drive the change we need to see in this country of ours.</p>
